Self-catalogue tool allows inputting sequences in a FASTA format (example file can be downloaded on the website) or a list of accessions in a text or csv file and finds and visualizes the corresponding metadata. Selection of the sequence type is essential prior to file upload. 

Note:
Due to NCBI fetch entrez limits, 10 sequences can be processed for a second.
